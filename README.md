🧠🔐 Intrusion Detection System in Artificial Intelligence with Cyber Security

This project is an AI-powered **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** designed to enhance **cybersecurity** by detecting unauthorized or malicious activities in network traffic. Built using Python and machine learning, it classifies traffic as normal or intrusive, helping organizations safeguard their networks from evolving cyber threats.

## 📌 Project Overview

  **Goal**: To develop a smart intrusion detection system using Artificial Intelligence to identify cyber attacks in real time.
  **Approach**: Use machine learning models to analyze network behavior and detect anomalies or known attack signatures.
  **Application**: Can be deployed in enterprise networks, firewalls, or any security monitoring system.

## 🚀 Features

 Machine Learning-based threat detection
 High accuracy in classifying attack types
 Protection against common cyber threats (e.g., DoS, Probe, R2L, U2R)
 Visual reports on detection results
 Trained on NSL-KDD or similar dataset
 Alerts for suspected attacks
 Easy to run and modify (developed in PyCharm)
